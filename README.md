# Github Users List

Created for educational purposes, this is a simple React+Express App 
that lists all users in the Github Database. It was made to exemplify 
the use of APIs with React using JavaScript built-in Fetch API. For 
bigger projects, is best to use more complete packages, such as Axios 
and even Redux for state management.

All the styling was made using [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
